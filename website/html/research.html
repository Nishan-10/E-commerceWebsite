                                <p>Ekta Books is one of the pioneers in the book publishing and distribution in Nepal. It is one among
                                    the line of a few book publishers that have successfully completed a long journey. From its humble
                                    roots in Patan, Ekta Books has come a long way to being the best in the publishing sector. Its
                                    quality in both material and content in textbooks and academic books is unrivalled.

                                <p>As of the present moment, Nepal Mandala Book Shop is the sole vendor of Books Mandala and a local
                                    bookstore, based at Lakeside, Pokhara. Since 1991, Nepal Mandala Book Shop has existed as a tiny
                                    island of peace in a fast-moving world. Thriving and growing every year, the business that started
                                    from a post-card board selling postcards to tourists in the heart of Lakeside has grown to be one
                                    of the hidden jewels of Pokhara with floor-to-ceiling stacks of books and a generally inclusive
                                    vibe that makes it seem like a neighborhood spot for anyone and everyone. The bookshop is one of
                                    the largest book distributors in Nepal. The shelves store an endless choice of books and the
                                    catalogue is always growing. You can take time browsing the seemingly endless selection of rare
                                    coffee table books and attractive souvenir items.</p>
