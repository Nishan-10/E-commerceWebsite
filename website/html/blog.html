                            <p id="two">Technology has revolutionized our planet and our daily lives over time. Furthermore, technological advancements have provided us with incredible tools and resources, allowing us to access critical information at any time. Multi-functional devices, such as the smartwatch and smartphone, have been made possible by modern technology. Computers are becoming more powerful, portable, and rapid than ever before. Technology has made our life easier, faster, better, and more enjoyable as a result of all of these advancements. People use technology in their daily lives since it is our major form of communication, therefore it is more of a necessity than an addiction for us.
                                Teenagers, as well as children who are not yet teenagers, are becoming addicted to technology at an early age. Children are becoming more sedentary and inattentive as a result of technology. They are growing addicted to using phones, computers, and the internet, which is having an impact on their academic achievement. It's one thing to use the internet and technology, but it's quite another to abuse them and become addicted to them. Because excessive use of technology is dangerous, it will not help you live a better or more social life. This is something that not only children, but also parents and elderly, should keep in mind and avoid overusing. It's gotten to the point that it's causing them problems in their personal life. As a result of technology improvements, education and learning have improved.
